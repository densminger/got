Objective:
To successfully complete missions as captain of the Orville, and defend the Planetary Union against the Kaylon.

Similar to AC/DC, where a mode is started/continued on each ball.  Starting the mode will earn the mission, but completing the mode will turn it a different color and earn more points during the wizard mode (similar to Monster Bash).

Missions Overview:

These are just suggestions for now - need to limit this to only 7

Hide the Cigarettes
Help Bortus and Klyden hide the cigarettes after their newfound addiction to chain smoking.  Timed mode. Random shots are lit and player tries to hit each shot (hide a cigarette) to hide as many cigarettes as possible before timer expires.  Hiding (6? 7?) cigarettes completes the mission.

Jar of Pickles
Spinner mode, with a twist. Player must hit the spinner to build the strength meter. Strength meter builds much faster if player hits the spinner from the right flipper instead of left flipper (to count as a right flipper shot, the right flipper has to be engaged within a second of the spinner spinning, and the left flipper must not have been engaged within a second or two). Once the strength meter is built high enough, a shot to the right orbit collects and ends the mode.  Note, because of the right flipper checks, multiball might not be allowed during this mode - or if it is, then all shots count as "medium" strength or something.

Don't Step on Yaphit!
Yaphit is wandering around Engineering and you have to make sure not to step on him.  Shots are lit during this mode where Yaphit is standing. Hits to those shots are penalized. Only thing is, you've got a job to do! Other shots are lit for points and mode completion.
